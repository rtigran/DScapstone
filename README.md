Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against Space X for a rocket launch. We will create  a machine learning pipeline to predict the first stage result for launches.
So main question is to determine prediction methodology for the given data set of features about Falcon 9 rocket launch, whether the first stage pass successfully or fail.
